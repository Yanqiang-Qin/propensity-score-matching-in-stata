It can be loaded with the following command:\r\n```stata\r\nwebuse cattaneo2\r\n```\r\nThe data in `cattaneo2` is a subset of data that was analysed in the following journal articles:\r\n\r\n* Almond, D., Chay, K.Y., Lee, D.S., 2005. *The costs of low birth weight,* Quarterly Journal of Economics 120, 1031-1083.\r\n\r\n* Cattaneo, M.D. 2010. *Efficient semiparametric estimation of multi-valued treatment effects under ignorability,* Journal of Econometrics, 155(2), 138-154.\r\n\r\nThe dataset included information about infant/mother/father characteristics from singleton births in Pennsylvania between 1989 and 1991.  The original dataset included nearly 500,000 births.  The STATA example dataset includes 4642 births.\r\n\r\n>**RESEARCH QUESTION**: What is the effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy on the infant's birthweight?\r\n\r\nThe dataset includes the following set of variables:\r\n\r\nInfant | Mother | Father\r\n:--- | :--- | :---\r\nbirth weight (grams) | married/not married |\r\nbirth month | hispanic (yes/no) | hispanic (yes/no)\r\n | race (white/not white) | race (white/not white)\r\n | age | age\r\n | education | education\r\n | foreign born (yes/no) |\r\n | birth number |\r\n | months since last birth |\r\n | infant of previous births died (yes/no) |\r\n | number of prenatal care visits |\r\n | trimester of first prenatal care visit |\r\n | alcohol during pregnancy (yes/no) |\r\n | smoking during pregnancy (0, 1-5, 6-10, 11+ daily) |\r\n | smoking during pregnancy (yes/no) |\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can access the complete codebook with the command `codebook` after loading the data.\r\n\r\n\r\n## BIG PICTURE: BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n<table style = \"table-layout: fixed;width: 100%;\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th align=\"left\" style=\"width:25%;\"></th>\r\n<th align=\"left\">Randomized Clinical Trial</th>\r\n<th align=\"left\">Observational Study</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align=\"left\">\r\n<strong>Treatment Assignment:</strong>\r\n</td>\r\n<td align=\"left\">Investigators generate a treatment schedule prior to patient enrollment.

In this lecture series, you have been exposed (not randomly) to a family of methods which use the propensity score.  The primary focus has been on propensity score matching.\r\n\r\n### STEPS (A SUMMARY OF STUART 2010)\r\n1. Defining “closeness”: the distance measure used to determine whether an individual is a good match for another.\r\n   1. Variables to include\r\n      * Researchers should thus be liberal in terms of including variables that may be associated with treatment assignment and/or the outcomes.\r\n      * One type of variable that should not be included in the  matching  process  is  any  variable  that  may  have been affected by the treatment of interest (Rosenbaum, 1984; Frangakis and Rubin, 2002; Greenland, 2003).\r\n   2. Distance Measures\r\n      * Exact\r\n      * Mahalanobis\r\n      * Propensity score / linear propensity score\r\n         * With propensity score estimation, concern is not with the parameter estimates of the model, but rather with the resulting balance of the covariates (Augurzky and Schmidt, 2001).\r\n2.  Implementing a matching method, given that measure of closeness.\r\n   * Methods:\r\n      1. k:1 Nearest Neighbor\r\n         * Estimates Average Treatment Effect in the Treated (ATT or ATET)\r\n         * May need a caliper\r\n      2. Subclassification\r\n      3. Full matching\r\n      4. Weighting (IPTW)\r\n   * Assess Common Support\r\n      *  Examining the common support may indicate that it is not possible to reliably estimate the ATE.\r\n3. Assessing the quality of the resulting matched samples, and perhaps iterating with steps 1 and 2 until well-matched samples result.\r\n   * Perhaps  the  most  important  step  in  using  matching methods is to diagnose the quality of the resulting matched samples\r\n   * Tools:\r\n      1. Histograms / Density Plots / ECDF\r\n      2. Standardized Bias / Standardized difference in means\r\n4. Analysis of the outcome and estimation of the treatment effect, given the matching done in step 3.\r\n   1. After k:1 mathcing\r\n      * May not need to account for matched pair\r\n      * Must use weights if matching was *with replacement*\r\n      * Use regression adjustment\r\n   2. After subclassification\r\n      * Aggregation weights determine estimation of ATT or ATE\r\n      * Use regression adjustment\r\n\r\n### DEMONSTRATION\r\n",
