## BACKGROUND

 | Randomized Clinical Trial | Observational Study
--- | --- | ---
**Treatment Assignment:** | Investigators generate a treatment schedule prior to patient enrollment.  The schedule is constructed based on the design of the study, which includes randomization in some fashion.  Physicians (who may be blind to treatment as well) assign treatments/exposures to study participants following the sequence in the schedule. | Phyicians assign treatment/exposure based on
* characteristics of the patient
* personal preference
* regional preference
* insurance restrictions
Study participants choose for themselves treatments or behaviors
Exposures are based on geographic location or cultural identity.
