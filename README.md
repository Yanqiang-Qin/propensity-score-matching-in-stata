## BACKGROUND

 | Randomized Clinical Trial | Observational Study
--- | --- | ---
**Treatment Assignment:** | Investigators generate a treatment schedule prior to patient enrollment.  The schedule is constructed based on the design of the study, which includes randomization in some fashion.  Physicians (who may be blind to treatment as well) assign treatments/exposures to study participants following the sequence in the schedule. | Phyicians assign treatment/exposure based on
* characteristics of the patient
* personal preference
* regional preference
* insurance restrictions
Study participants choose for themselves treatments or behaviors
Exposures are based on geographic location or cultural identity.

| Randomized Clinical Trial | Observational Study
:--- | :--- | :---
**Probability of Treatment:**| Known | Unknown, may be 0 or 1
**Covariate Balance:** | Relationship between covariates and treatment assignment are known from study design. Usually the study is designed so that there is no relationship between treatment assignment and covariates. | Relationship between covariates and treatment assignment is unknown.  There may be covariate imbalance.

## STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF TREATMENT EFFECTS WITH OBSERVATIONAL DATA

There are several methods for estimating a treatment effect with observational data.  In this lecture series, you have been exposed (not randomly) to a family of methods which use the propensity score.  The primary focus has been on propensity score matching.

## EXAMPLE DATA

The `cattaneo2` dataset is a STATA example dataset.  It can be loaded with the following command:
```stata
webuse cattaneo2
```
Access the codebook with the command `codebook`.

The data in `cattaneo2` is a subset of data that was analysed in the following journal articles:

* Almond, D., Chay, K.Y., Lee, D.S., 2005. *The costs of low birth weight,* Quarterly Journal of Economics 120, 1031-1083.

* Cattaneo, M.D. 2010. *Efficient semiparametric estimation of multi-valued treatment effects under ignorability,* Journal of Econometrics, 155(2), 138-154.

The dataset included information about infant/mother/father characteristics from singleton births in Pennsylvania between 1989 and 1991.  The original dataset included nearly 500,000 births.  The STATA example dataset includes 4642 births.

### GOAL

Estimate the effect of maternal smoking on infant birthweight.
